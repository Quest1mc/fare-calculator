Your Uber fare is first calculated on 4 main criteria:
    • Base (or initial) fare – A flat fee charged at the beginning of every ride
    • Cost per minute – How much you are charged for each minute you are inside the ride
    • Cost per mile – How much you are charged for each mile of the ride
    • Booking Fee (Formerly ‘Safe Rides Fee’) – A flat fee to cover Uber’s ‘operating costs’ (Not included for Uber’s more luxury services like UberBlack or UberSUV)
Here’s how Uber uses the 4 main criteria above to calculate your fare:
Base Fare + (Cost per minute * time in ride) + (Cost per mile * ride distance) + Booking Fee = Your Fare
